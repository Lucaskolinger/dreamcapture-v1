## Source Code for Version 1 (Deprecated)

First version of a personal Website for a friend of mine (Movie Production). 
It was one of my first bigger projects where I learned a lot of the core concepts of CSS and Vue js.
It was a big playground for me and it's accordingly messy.

## Tech-stack

- Vue.js + Nuxt.js (V2) with options API
- SCSS
- Nuxt Content with dynamic components
- Hosted on Netlify
- Cloudinary for Images
